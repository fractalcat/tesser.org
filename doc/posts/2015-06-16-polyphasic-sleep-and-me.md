title: Polyphasic sleep and me

Every so often I get an email from someone who's heard about me in the
context of
[polyphasic sleep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphasic_sleep)
(usually via
[this post](http://www.puredoxyk.com/index.php/2009/07/24/uberman-too-wussy-for-you-try-tesla/)
by puredoxyk) and is curious why nothing on my current website relates
to it. This post is for them.

# Background

I experimented with polyphasic sleep from around 2009-2010. I first
became interested after reading puredoxyk's reports of success with
the
[Uberman schedule](http://www.polyphasicsociety.com/polyphasic-sleep/overviews/uberman-2/)
of six twenty-minute naps per day,
as I was both chronically insomniac and chronically lacking in time. I was in
high school when I started, and was unable to make Uberman fit with my
classes. I could have tried the more forgiving 
[Everyman](http://www.polyphasicsociety.com/polyphasic-sleep/overviews/everyman/),
but I was young and ambitious so my friend Joseph and I decided
to drop two 20-minute naps from Uberman, rebalance the spacing to make
it even time-wise, and called it 'Tesla' (after Nikola Tesla's
probably-apocryphal habit of sleeping less than two hours per day). I
maintained this schedule through a significant part of my schooling,
and then again sporadically during 2010.

# Current status

I have slept monophasically (unfortunately not eight hours per night,
but in one contiguous block) since 2011, and I don't anticipate trying
a polyphasic pattern again[^caveat].

I also don't think it's likely that polyphasic sleep has the benefits
I used to think it did:

 - To my knowledge there is no hard evidence that the conjectured
   effects on sleep stage (i.e., faster onset of REM sleep which fills
   the majority of the 20-minute nap period) actually happen. This is
   the sort of thing that would be easy to establish with a volunteer
   and an EEG, but I'm not in a position to do this myself at this
   stage (I have EEGs, but I don't have a spare week in which to be an
   irritable zombie).
 - I know more about brains now than I did when I was seventeen, and I
   think it's quite unlikely that NREM sleep can be sharply decreased
   without impacting function; among other things it's been repeatedly
   associated with memory consolidation (I don't have time to track
   down the references right now, but feel free to email me if you're
   curious).

As to how I was able to function well enough to get to school and
write code while sleeping eighty minutes per day, I suspect a
few factors were involved:

 - Youth - seventeen years of age is an evolutionarily-privileged stage of life
   for inducing stress on the body and mind.
 - Practice - I was and am a chronic insomniac, and frequently didn't
   get more than a few hours of sleep per night (often none). I've
   picked up a lot of tricks for functioning on very little sleep.
 - I didn't, really. I got by, but by comparison with the me of 2015
   (who has become somewhat better at getting closer to a full night's
   sleep) my fluid intelligence and working memory were shot the whole
   time.

So that's me and polyphasic sleep. Feel free to email me if you have
any questions, and particularly if you know of any research (published
or otherwise) on how patterns like Uberman affect the brain.

[^caveat]: I might consider it if anyone felt like putting together a well-designed study including EEG data, and recruited some other participants, and I didn't have an office-hours job at the time, For Science.
